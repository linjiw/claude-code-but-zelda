```

## Why Not Use Copyrighted Sounds?

- Nintendo actively protects their IP
- Using copyrighted sounds could lead to legal issues
- Original or royalty-free sounds are safer and customizable
- You can create unique sounds for your workflow

## Recommended Approach

1. Use the beep sounds we generated as placeholders
2. Visit Bfxr or ChipTone to create custom 8-bit sounds
3. Download royalty-free game sounds from legal sources
4. Customize them to your preference

This way you get great sounds without any legal concerns!
