## 🔧 If GitHub Pages Doesn't Work:

### Alternative: Use GitHub's automatic setup
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Choose "GitHub Actions" as source
3. Select "Static HTML" workflow
4. GitHub will create the workflow for you

### Or manually create `.github/workflows/pages.yml`:
```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: './docs'
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators:

When it's working, you'll see:
- ✅ Green checkmark next to latest commit
- 🌐 "github-pages" environment in repo sidebar
