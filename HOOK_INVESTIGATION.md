# üîç Claude Code Hook Investigation

## Current Findings

### 1. Configuration Location
- ‚úÖ **Found:** `~/.claude/settings.json` (not `~/.config/claude/`)
- ‚úÖ **Schema:** Uses `claude-code-settings.json` schema

### 2. Hook Support Status: UNCERTAIN

Based on our tests, Claude Code might:
1. **Not support custom hooks yet** in the current version
2. **Use a different hook format** than documented
3. **Require a specific Claude Code plan** (Pro/Enterprise)
4. **Need hooks enabled via command-line flag**

### 3. Evidence

**What we know:**
- Claude Code uses internal tools (List, Read, Bash, etc.)
- Settings.json exists and is read by Claude
- No documentation found via --help for hooks
- User feedback mentions PowerShell hooks (Windows)

**What's unclear:**
- Exact hook configuration format
- Which Claude Code version supports hooks
- If hooks are a beta/experimental feature

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: File System Watcher
Create a background process that watches Claude's activity:

```python
# watch_claude.py
import watchdog
import subprocess
from pathlib import Path

# Watch ~/.claude/shell-snapshots for activity
# Play sounds based on file changes
```

### Option 2: Terminal Integration
Use terminal-level hooks instead:

```bash
# In .zshrc or .bashrc
alias claude='claude_with_sounds'

claude_with_sounds() {
    command claude "$@"
    # Parse output and play sounds
}
```

### Option 3: Wrapper Script
Create a Claude wrapper that intercepts commands:

```python
# claude_wrapper.py
import subprocess
import sys

# Intercept Claude Code output
# Play sounds based on success/error patterns
```

### Option 4: Direct Audio in Shell
Modify shell to play sounds on command completion:

```bash
# In .zshrc
precmd() {
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        afplay ~/sounds/success.wav &
    else
        afplay ~/sounds/error.wav &
    fi
}
```

## Verification Steps Taken

1. ‚úÖ Located correct settings file: `~/.claude/settings.json`
2. ‚úÖ Tried multiple hook formats:
   - `notification/stop` commands
   - `onSuccess/onError` paths
   - `on-success/on-error` paths
   - Direct sound paths
3. ‚úÖ Created executable hook scripts
4. ‚úÖ Tested hooks work independently

## Why Hooks Might Not Work

1. **Feature not released:** Hooks might be planned but not implemented
2. **Enterprise only:** Could require paid Claude Code plan
3. **Different trigger:** Might use different event names
4. **OS specific:** Might only work on certain platforms
5. **Version mismatch:** Need specific Claude Code version

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Check Claude Code Version
```bash
claude --version
# Check if latest version
```

### 2. Check Official Documentation
- Visit Claude Code official docs
- Look for hook/extension documentation
- Check release notes for hook support

### 3. Try Terminal-Level Solution
Since Claude Code might not support hooks yet, implement at terminal level:

```bash
# Quick workaround
function ls() {
    command ls "$@"
    afplay ~/sounds/success.wav &
}
```

### 4. Contact Support
Ask Anthropic support about:
- Hook support in current version
- Correct configuration format
- When hooks will be available

## Conclusion

**Current Status:** Hooks configured but not triggering

**Likely Reason:** Claude Code doesn't support custom hooks in current version

**Best Alternative:** Terminal-level sound integration

**Future:** Wait for official hook support announcement
