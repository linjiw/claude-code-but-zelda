## ‚úÖ Fixed: Windows FileNotFoundError Issue Resolved

Hi @dengshu2! Thank you for reporting this issue. I've successfully resolved the Windows compatibility problem and published the fix to NPM.

### üîß What was wrong?
The hook script was attempting to use PowerShell without proper error handling, causing a `FileNotFoundError` when PowerShell wasn't accessible or when the command syntax wasn't compatible with the Windows environment.

### üõ†Ô∏è How it was fixed:
I've implemented a robust multi-layered fallback system for Windows sound playback:

1. **Primary Method: `winsound` module** - Uses Python's built-in Windows sound module (fastest, most reliable)
2. **Secondary Method: PowerShell variants** - Tries multiple PowerShell executables (`powershell.exe`, `pwsh.exe`, etc.)
3. **Tertiary Method: Windows Media Player** - Falls back to `cmd.exe` with the `start` command

Each method fails gracefully if unavailable, ensuring the hook never crashes Claude Code.

### üì¶ Update Instructions:
The fix is now available in **version 3.0.1**:

```bash
npm update -g zelda-claude-code
```

Or if you haven't installed it yet:
```bash
npm install -g zelda-claude-code@latest
```

### ‚ú® Additional Improvements:
Along with the Windows fix, I've also added:

- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline**: All future updates are now tested on Windows, macOS, and Linux before release
- **Cross-platform test suite**: Ensures compatibility across all platforms
- **Better error handling**: More graceful failures across all operating systems

### üß™ Testing:
The fix has been tested with:
- ‚úÖ Windows 10/11 with PowerShell 5.1
- ‚úÖ Windows with PowerShell Core 7.x
- ‚úÖ Windows without PowerShell (using winsound fallback)
- ‚úÖ All Python versions 3.8-3.12

### üìä Verification:
You can verify the fix works by:
1. Starting a new Claude Code session - you should hear the startup sound
2. Running commands - you should hear success/error sounds
3. Completing todos - you should hear the completion sound

If you still experience any issues after updating, please let me know with:
- Your Windows version
- Python version (`python --version`)
- Any error messages you see

Thank you again for your patience and for helping make Zelda Claude Code better for Windows users! üéÆ‚ú®
